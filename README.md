ReadList
========

I wanted a quick and simple way to keep a list of things I've read online,
so I made a console app that turns input into a json file that can then be used
as data for something like an AngularJS app.

My very basic use of the output can be seen at http://www.drewm.ca/ReadingList/
which was created using AngularJS.
